**Question 1:** What is the main difference between few-shot and zero-shot prompting?
- A) Few-shot uses examples in the prompt, zero-shot does not
- B) Few-shot is faster than zero-shot
- C) Zero-shot requires fine-tuning the model
- D) They are the same technique

**Question 2:** In Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, what phrase is commonly added to encourage step-by-step reasoning?
- A) "Be creative"
- B) "Let's think step by step"
- C) "Answer quickly"
- D) "Use advanced terminology"

**Question 3:** (Multi-select) Which are valid benefits of Self-Consistency with CoT? (Select all that apply)
- A) Generates multiple reasoning paths
- B) Reduces hallucinations through majority voting
- C) Eliminates the need for examples
- D) Improves reliability of complex reasoning tasks

**Question 4:** What is the key characteristic of Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) prompting?
- A) It uses a single linear reasoning path
- B) It explores multiple reasoning branches and backtracks if needed
- C) It only works with GPT-4
- D) It requires external tools

**Question 5:** In the ReAct pattern, what does ReAct stand for?
- A) Reactive Actions
- B) Reasoning and Acting
- C) Real-time Actions
- D) Recursive Activities

**Question 6:** (Y/N) The ReAct pattern alternates between generating reasoning traces and task-specific actions.

**Question 7:** What is meta-prompting?
- A) Using prompts to generate or improve other prompts
- B) A deprecated prompting technique
- C) Prompting about metadata only
- D) A technique exclusive to image generation

**Question 8:** (Multi-select) Which are valid prompt composition patterns? (Select all that apply)
- A) Prompt chaining (sequential steps)
- B) Prompt ensembling (multiple models/prompts)
- C) Prompt deletion
- D) Conditional branching in prompts

**Question 9:** In Semantic Kernel, which execution setting should you use for CoT reasoning tasks that require reliability?
- A) Temperature = 0.0, with Self-Consistency (multiple samples)
- B) Temperature = 1.0, single sample
- C) Temperature = 0.5, TopP = 0.1
- D) MaxTokens = 100

**Question 10:** What is the primary advantage of prompt chaining over a single monolithic prompt?
- A) It's always faster
- B) It breaks complex tasks into manageable steps with intermediate validation
- C) It uses less tokens
- D) It doesn't require a kernel
